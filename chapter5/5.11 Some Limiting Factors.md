# Optimizing Program Performance
## 5.11 Some Limiting Factors
### 5.11.1 Register Spilling
If the number variables exceeds the number of available registers, the loop unrolling may lead to performance degradation.

### 5.11.2 Branch Prediction and Misprediction Penalties
The bound checking can be achieved in parallel with other operations. The CPU can also discern the regular patterns and long-term trends for the different branch instructions. So in many cases, the branch will not hamper the program efficiency.

If it is necessary to use conditional moves, which cannot be directly controlled by programmer, we can try to compute *all* the values, and update them, instead of selectively compute and update.
