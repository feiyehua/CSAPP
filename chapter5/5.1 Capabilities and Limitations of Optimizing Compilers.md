# Optimizing Program Performance
## 5.1 Capabilities and Limitations of Optimizing Compilers
### Key Concepts
*optimization blockers*: The code that compilers cannot optimize readily

*safe optimizations*: optimizations that makes the optimized code behave the same as the unoptimized version in all possible cases
### memory aliasing
*memory aliasing*: 2 pointers designate the same memory location
```c
void twiddle1(long *xp, long *yp) {
    *xp += *yp;
    *xp += *yp;
}

void twiddle2(long *xp, long *yp) {
    *xp += 2 * *yp;
}
```
The 2 functions behave differently wen `xp == yp`.

To perform safe optimizations, the compiler must assume that different pointers may be aliased.

## 5.2 Expressing Program Performance
*CPE*: cycles per element. This can help us to understand the loop performance of an iterative program.
