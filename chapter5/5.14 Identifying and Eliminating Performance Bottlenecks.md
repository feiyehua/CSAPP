# Optimizing Program Performance 

## 5.14 Identifying and Eliminating Performance Bottlenecks

### 5.14.1 Program Profiling

We use `gprof` as our profiler. It can count the CPU time and the number of each function call.

The profiled program should be compiled using `-pg`, and potentially add `-Og` to guarantee that function calls will be tracked properly.

Then, run the program `./a.out`, and invoke `gprof` to analyze the profile data `gprof ./a.out`.
