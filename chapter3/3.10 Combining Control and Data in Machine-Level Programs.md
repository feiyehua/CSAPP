# Combining Control and Data in Machine-Level Programs

Modern progames, compilers, and operating systems work together to prevent the machine from being attacked, 
espicially Out-of-Bounds Memory References and Buffer Overflow.

The measures taken includes Stack Randomization, Stack Corruption Detection using canary random values, and Limiting Executable Code Regions.

## Supporting Variable-Size Stack Frames

If stack frame size cannot be determined at compile time, register `%rbp` will serves
as a *frame pointer*, or *base pointer*. Together with `%rsp`, the program can therefore manage the size of stack frame.
