# Linking

## 7.7 Relocation
After resolving symbols, the linker merges the input modules and assigns run-time addresses to each symbol. This includes 2 steps:
+ *Relocating sections and symbol definitions.* The linker merges sections of the same type into a new aggregate section of the same type. The, the linker assign run-time memory addresses (absolute) to new aggregate sections, each sections defined by the input modules, and to each symbol defined by the input modules.
+ *Relocating symbol references within sections.* The linker modifies every symbol reference so that they point to the correct run-time address.

### 7.7.1 Relocation Entries
A *relocation entry* tells the linker how to modify the reference when it merges the object file into an executable. 

### 7.7.2 Relocating Symbol References
#### Relocating PC-Relative References


#### Relocating Absolute References
