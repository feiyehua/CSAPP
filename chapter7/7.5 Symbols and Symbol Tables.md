# Linking
## 7.5 Symbols and Symbol Tables

Each relocatable object module (file) *m* contains information about the symbols.
In the context of a linker, there are three different kinds of symbols:
+ Global symbols defined by module *m*, including nonstatic C functions and global variables.
+ Global symbols referenced by module *m* but defined by some other module, including nonstatic C functions and global variables in other modules.
+ Local symbols defined and referenced exclusively by module *m*, including static C functions and global variables that are defined with the static attribute.

The local nonstatic program variable are managed at run time on stack. However, the compiler allocate space in `.data` or `.bss` for local static program variables, and create unique name in symbol table for them.

Symbol tables contains the 3 types of symbols, each symbol with an entry in the symbol table.

Each symbol is assigned to some section of object file, including 3 special pseudosections:
+ ABS: symbols should not be relocated
+ UNDEF: undefined symbols (symbols referenced in module but defined elsewhere)
+ COMMON: disable by newer versions of `gcc` by default.
