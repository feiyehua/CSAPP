# Linking
## 7.11 Loading and Linking Shared Libraries from Applications
It is also possible that an application requests the dynamic linker to load and link arbitrary shared libraries while the application is running.

Linux provides `dlopen` call to invoke dynamic linker to load and link shared libraries at run time, and `dlsym` to find a symbol's address.
