# Linking
## 7.13 Library Interpositioning
Linux linkers support a powerful technique, called *library interpositioning*, that allows you to intercept calls to shared library functions and execute your own code instead.

### 7.13.1 Compile-Time Interpositioning
Simply use the preprocessor.

### 7.13.2 Link-Time Interpositioning
Using `--wrap f` flag, the linker resolve references to `f` as `__wrap_f`, `__real_f` as `f`.

### 7.13.3 Run-Time Interpositioning
This only requires access to the executable file.

By changing `LD_PRELOAD` environmental variable, we can interpose on any function in any shared library.
