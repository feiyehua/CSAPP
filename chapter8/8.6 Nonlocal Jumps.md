# Exceptional Control Flow
## 8.6 Nonlocal Jumps
*nonlocal jump* is a form of user-level exceptional control flow. This transfers control from one function to another function without having to go through normal call-and-return sequence.

The `setjmp` function saves the current calling environment in the env buffer, for later use by `longjmp`, and returns 0. 

The `longjmp` function restores the calling environment from the env buffer and then triggers a return from the most recent `setjmp` call that initialized `env`. The `setjmp` then returns with the nonzero return value `retval`.

So `setjmp` returns multiple times and `longjmp` never returns.
