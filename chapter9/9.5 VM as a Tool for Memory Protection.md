# Virtual Memory
## 9.5 VM as a Tool for Memory Protection
By adding additional permission bits to PTE, the OS can provide better access control on memory pages.

+ SUP bit: whether processes must be running in kernel (supervisor) mode to access the page
+ READ and WRITE bits: indicate whether the program can read (write) this memory page

If an instruction violates these permissions, the CPU triggers a fault that transfer control to an exception handler in the kernel, then the kernel sends a SIGSEGV to the process.
