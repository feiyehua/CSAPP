# Virtual Memory
## 9.4 VM as a Tool for Memory Management

Operating Systems provide a separate page table and a separate virtual address space for each process.

This simplifies linking and loading, the sharing of code and data, and allocating memory to application.
+ Linking: all programs share the same run time memory layout.
+ Loading: The loader never actually copies any data from disk to memory. They simply allocates virtual memory pages for code and data segments and marks them as invalid. The data are paged in automatically and on demand. This notion of mapping a set of contiguous virtual pages to an arbitrary location in an arbitrary file is known as *memory mapping*.
+ Sharing: OS can arrange for multiple processes to share a single copy of (operating system kernel) code by mapping appropriate virtual pages in different processes to the same physical pages.
+ Memory allocation: When a program running in a user process requests additional heap space, the OS allocates a number of virtual pages and maps them to physical pages. The physical pages can scatter randomly in physical memory.
