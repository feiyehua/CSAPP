# Virtual Memory
## 9.7 Case Study: The Intel Core i7/Linux Memory System
### 9.7.1 Core i7 Address Translation
In practice, the CPU only use 40 bits to store the physical address, and uses the rest bits to store the status/attribute of the memory page.

Core i7 implements a sophisticated multi-level page table.

### 9.7.2 Linux Virtual Memory System
#### Linux Virtual Memory Areas
Linux divided virtual memory into areas. Each virtual memory page belongs to an area, allowing virtual address space to have gaps.

#### Linux Page Fault Exception Handling
The kernel page fault handler performs the following steps:
1. Search the list of areas and determine if the address is legal
2. Determine if the access is legal
3. Select a victim page, swap out the page if it is dirty, swap in the new page and update the page table
