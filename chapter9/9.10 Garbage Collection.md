## 9.10 Garbage Collection
A *garbage collector* is a dynamic storage allocator that automatically frees allocated blocks that are no longer needed by the program. Such blocks are known as *garbage*.

### 9.10.1 Garbage Collector Basics
The garbage collector maintains a directed reachability graph. The blocks in heap are *heap nodes*, and pointers whose locations are in registers, stack, and global variable areas are root nodes. When a heap node is no longer reachable from any root node, this heap node becomes garbage.

### 9.10.2 Mark&Sweep Garbage Collectors
A Mark&Sweep garbage collector consists of a *mark* phase, which marks all reachable and allocated descendants of the root nodes, followed by a *sweep* phase, which frees each unmarked allocated block.
