# Virtual Memory
Virtual memory provides three important capabilities:
+ Uses main memory as a cache of disk, keeping only the active areas in memory
+ Provides each process with a uniform address space
+ Protects the address space of each process from corruption by other processes.
## 9.1 Physical and Virtual Addressing
*physical addressing*: CPU uses physical address to reference memory

*virtual addressing*: CPU accesses the main memory by generating a *virtual address*, then MMU (*memory management unit* on CPU) performs the *address translation*.
